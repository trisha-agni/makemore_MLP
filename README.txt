(In progress) Description: In this project I have implemented a multilayer perceptron (MLP) character-level language model.

What I learned:

Python:
- torch
  - randn(): initialize a tensor with random numbers from a normal distribution
  - view(): change dimensions of a tensor (ex: [9, 2] --> [6, 3])
  - cross_entropy(): computes loss


Math:


AI:
- Context length: number of tokens the model can process at once
- Embeddings: --------------
